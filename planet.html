            <h2>Mercury</h2>
            <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the solar system. It has a rocky surface and no atmosphere to speak of, which means it experiences extreme temperature variations between its day and night sides.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Venus</h2>
            <p>Venus is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to their similar size and composition. However, Venus has a thick atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in the solar system.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Earth</h2>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a diverse range of ecosystems, including oceans, forests, deserts, and polar regions, and is home to millions of species, including humans.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Mars</h2>
            <p>Mars is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance caused by iron oxide on its surface. It has polar ice caps, canyons, and extinct volcanoes, and has been a major target for exploration due to the possibility of past life and potential for future colonization.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Jupiter</h2>
            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It has a strong magnetic field, numerous moons, and a distinctive banded appearance caused by its fast rotation.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Saturn</h2>
            <p>Saturn is known for its spectacular ring system, which is made up of countless icy particles. It is the second-largest planet in the solar system and has a low density, which means it could theoretically float in water if a large enough ocean were available.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Uranus</h2>
            <p>Uranus is an ice giant planet that is tipped on its side, causing it to rotate almost perpendicular to its orbit around the Sun. It has a set of narrow rings and a blue-green coloration due to methane in its atmosphere.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Neptune</h2>
            <p>Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and is known for its vivid blue coloration. It has strong winds, icy clouds, and a storm system known as the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</p>
